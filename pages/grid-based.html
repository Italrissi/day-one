                <p>"I bet you've never heard ol' Marshal Dillon say
                    Miss Kitty, have you ever thought of runnin' away?
                    Settlin' down, would you marry me
                    If I asked you twice and begged you, pretty please?
                    She'd have said, "Yes", in a New York minute
                    They never tied the knot, his heart wasn't in it
                    He just stole a kiss as he rode away
                    He never hung his hat up at Kitty's place
                    I should've been a cowboy
                    I should've learned to rope and ride
                    Wearin' my six-shooter, ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
                    Stealin' the young girls' hearts
                    Just like Gene and Roy
                    Singin' those campfire songs
                    Woah, I should've been a cowboy!"

                    And I wrote your number on the 50-yard line
                    You were always the perfect one and a valedictorian
                    So under your number I wrote "Call for a good time"
                    I only wanted to get your attention
                    But you overlooked me somehow
                    Besides, you had too many boyfriends to mention
                    And I played my guitar too loud
                    How do you like me now?
                    How do you like me now?
                    Now that I'm on my way
                    Do you still think I'm crazy standing here today?
                    I couldn't make you love me but I always dreamed about livin' in your radio
                    How do you like me now?"

        <h1>Fluid Dimensions Experiment</h1>
        <p>So far we have been building our web pages with fixed dimensions. Our sizes have been determined by pixels. 
        That was the old way of building websites when screen sizes were more uniform. Modern websites are viewed on a variety 
        of screen sizes and we want our content to begin to fit to the window it is being viewed in. We will begin to utilize 
        percentages, em, and rem to make our site fluid. To be a proper fluid web site the content should be adjusting and 
        flowing according to the viewport between media breaks.</p>

    <section class="pure-u-1-3 wide em">
        <h3>EM</h3>
        <p>An em is a unit in the field of typography, equal to the currently specified point size. For example, one em in a 16-point typeface is 16 points. 
        Therefore, this unit is the same for all typefaces at a given point size.[1]
        Typographic measurements using this unit are frequently expressed in decimal notation (e.g., 0.7em) or as fractions of 100 or 1000 (e.g. 70/100em or 700/1000em).
        The name "em" was originally a reference to the width of the capital "M" in the typeface and size being used, which was often the same as the point size.

    <section class="pure-u-1-3 rem">
        <h3>REM</h3>
        <p>CSS3 introduces a few new units, including the rem unit, which stands for "root em". If this hasn't put you to sleep yet, then let's look at how rem works.
        The em unit is relative to the font-size of the parent, which causes the compounding issue. The rem unit is relative to the root—or the html—element. 
        That means that we can define a single font size on the html element and define all rem units to be a percentage of that.

    <section class="pure-u-1-3 wide percent">
    <h3>PERCENTAGE</h3>
        <p>The percentage CSS data types represent a percentage value. Many CSS properties can take percentage values, often to define sizes in terms of parent objects. 
        Percentages are formed by a number immediately followed by the percentage sign %. Just as is the case with all other units in CSS, there isn't a space between 
        the '%' and the number.
        Many length properties use percentages, such as width, margin and padding. Percentages can also be seen in font-size, where the size of the text is directly 
        related to the size of its parent.

    <h3>BOX SIZING</h3>
        <p>The box-sizing CSS property is used to alter the default CSS box model used to calculate widths and heights of elements. 
            It is possible to use this property to emulate the behavior of browsers that do not correctly support the CSS box model specification.</p>

    <section class="pure-u-1-3 wide vw">
        <h3>VW</h3>
        <p>Often times, there are certain elements within our design that we'd like to ensure can fit into the viewport in their entirety. Normally, we'd have to 
        use JavaScript to do this. Check the size of the viewport and then resize any elements on the page accordingly. If the user resizes the browser then 
        the script runs again to resize the elements on the page.
        With vw/vh, we can size elements to be relative to the size of the viewport. The vw/vh units are interesting in that 1 unit reflects 1/100th the width 
        of the viewport. To make an element the full width of the viewport, for example, you'd set it to width:100vw.
