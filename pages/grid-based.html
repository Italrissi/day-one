                Settlin' down, would you marry me
                If I asked you twice and begged you, pretty please?

                He never hung his hat up at Kitty's place
                I should've been a cowboy
                I should've learned to rope and ride
                Wearin' my six-shooter, ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
                Stealin' the young girls' hearts

			<p>“The Internet as we know it really got started in the early 1960s. That was when J.C.R. Licklider — a computer scientist with technology company Bolt, 
				Beranek and Newman (BBN) — formulated a few unique ideas about global networking in a series of memos, describing an <b>"Intergalactic Computer Network."</b><br>
				His idea: link computers together across the globe; and anybody near a computer could share information. As it turns out, Licklider had the right idea at the right 
				time. The Cold War had the United States searching for a communication network that 
				could survive a nuclear attack.”<br>

                    You were always the perfect one and a valedictorian
