                    Settlin' down, would you marry me
                    If I asked you twice and begged you, pretty please?
                    She'd have said, "Yes", in a New York minute
                    They never tied the knot, his heart wasn't in it
                    He just stole a kiss as he rode away
                    He never hung his hat up at Kitty's place
                    I should've been a cowboy
                    I should've learned to rope and ride
                    Wearin' my six-shooter, ridin' my pony on a cattle drive
                    Stealin' the young girls' hearts
                    Just like Gene and Roy
                    Singin' those campfire songs

                    You were always the perfect one and a valedictorian
                    So under your number I wrote "Call for a good time"
