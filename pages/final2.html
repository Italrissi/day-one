        <h3>What is Growth Mindset?</h3> 
             <h4>A growth mindset is a transformative approach to learning and development 
                 that empowers individuals to embrace challenges, persist through setbacks, 
                and ultimately achieve higher levels of success. Rooted in the belief that 
                abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work, 
                 it contrasts with a fixed mindset, which assumes that abilities are innate 
                and unchangeable.

            <h3>What Stops Growth?</h3>
                <p class="grid-4">
                    <h4>Central to the growth mindset is the idea that failures and difficulties are not 
                    indicators of a person's limitations, but rather opportunities for learning and 
                    improvement. Instead of viewing setbacks as discouraging roadblocks, individuals 
                    with a growth mindset see them as stepping stones on the path to mastery. This outlook 
                    fosters resilience and tenacity, enabling individuals to persevere in the face of obstacles.

                <p class="grid-4"> 
                    <h4>Embracing challenges is a cornerstone of the growth mindset. Rather than shying away from
                    difficult tasks, individuals actively seek them out, recognizing that they provide the 
                    greatest potential for growth. They approach challenges with a sense of curiosity and a 
                    willingness to stretch their abilities, knowing that even if they don't immediately succeed,
                    they are still expanding their skills and knowledge.

                <p class="grid-4">
                    <h4>Effort is highly valued in a growth mindset. It's understood that hard work, dedication, 
                    and deliberate practice are the keys to improvement. This mindset rejects the notion of 
                    innate talent as the primary determinant of success, instead attributing achievement to a 
                    combination of effort and strategy. This perspective empowers individuals to take ownership 
                    of their progress and strive for excellence.

                        <h4>Feedback is welcomed and appreciated in a growth mindset. Constructive criticism is
                             seen as an invaluable source of information for refining skills and knowledge. 
                             It's not taken personally, but rather as a means to accelerate growth and 
                             development.

                            They see others' achievements not as threats, but as evidence of what is possible 
                            with dedication and hard work. They are eager to learn from and collaborate with 
                            those who have excelled in their field.

                    <h4>In essence, the growth mindset is a powerful philosophy that unlocks human potential.
                    By embracing challenges, valuing effort, seeking feedback, and celebrating the 
                    success of others, individuals can cultivate a mindset that propels them toward 
                    continuous learning, improvement, and ultimately, their highest levels of
