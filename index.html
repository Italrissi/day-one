<p>Hector Guimard, the French architect and designer extraordinaire, left an indelible mark on the
world of Art Nouveau.  His innovative designs, like the iconic Castel Beranger, showcased his unparalleled talent and
set the stage for a new era in architecture.  Guimard's whimsical glass and iron creations for the Paris Metro stations added a touch of
elegance to the city's underground world. His work not only stood out but also stood the test of time, solidifying his legacy as a true
visionary in the realm of design. I was introduced to Guimard designer when I worked on a project last quarter and used the Art
Nouveau style.</p>
